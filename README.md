Dermalyze uses a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on the DermNet dataset. The model analyzes skin images to identify conditions such as acne, psoriasis, dermatitis, and more. It enables fast and preliminary assessment of potential dermatological conditions, with the ability to recognize 23 different skin diseases.
